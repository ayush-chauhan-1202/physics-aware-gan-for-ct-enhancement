# physics-aware-gan-for-ct-enhancement
End-to-end ML system for enhancing low-quality industrial CT images using a conditional GAN with physics-aware degradations, rigorous evaluation, and reproducible engineering.

# Problem Framing
In industrial X-ray CT and NDE imaging:

- High-quality scans are slow and expensive

- Faster scans introduce noise, blur, and artefacts

- Operators want ML systems that can recover quality from degraded data

This project simulates realistic degradation and trains a GAN to perform:

- Denoising

- Super-resolution

- Artefact suppression
